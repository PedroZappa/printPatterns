## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/printpatterns.git
```

Make sure you have a C compiler installed, such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to compile the program.

## Usage

To compile the `printpatterns.c` program, navigate to the repository folder and run the following command:

```bash
gcc printpatterns.c -o printpatterns
```

This will create an executable file called `printpatterns`. To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./printpatterns
```

The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows for the pattern. Enter an integer value and press Enter to see the full-pyramid pattern printed on the screen.
